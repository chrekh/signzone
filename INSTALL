1) Obtain the source

From https://github.com/chrekh/signzone/releases/ or git://github.com/chrekh/signzone

2) Install the program, and the man-page.

 make install

That installs signzone under /usr/local using /bin/perl. You can also
specify different destination, and different perl.

 make PERL=/some/other/bin/perl INST=/some/other/prefix

3) Read the fine manual

 man signzone
 
4) Edit your configfile for signzone

 $EDITOR /etc/bind/signzone.conf

The absolute minimal configuration needed is zone.

5) Include the keydb-file in your zone-file.

 $EDITOR /var/named/your.zone.db
 (add $include your.zone-dnskey.db)

6) Run signzone (as the user owning the zonefiles)

 sudo -u named /usr/local/bin/signzone -sr

7) Add cronjob to run signzone daily.
