1) Obtain the source, and install the program, and the man-page

 git clone git://github.com/chrekh/signzone
 cd signzone
 make install

That installs signzone under /usr/local using /bin/perl. You can also
specify different destination, and different perl.

 make PERL=/some/other/bin/perl INST=/some/other/prefix

2) Read the fine manual

 man signzone
 
3) Edit your configfile for signzone

 vi /etc/bind/signzone.conf

The absolute minimal configuration needed is zone.

4) Run signzone (as the user owning the zonefiles)

 sudo -u named /usr/local/bin/signzone -sr

5 Add cronjob to run signzone daily.
